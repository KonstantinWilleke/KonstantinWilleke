### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm in pursuit of a doctoral degree at the Max Planck International Research School for Intelligent Systems, Univerity of TÃ¼bingen, and University of GÃ¶ttingen. Since 2019, I'm part of the Neuronal Intelligence Team, led by Fabian Sinz. I work in collaboration with Andreas Tolias, Alexander Ecker, Katrin Franke, and Ziad Hafed, with whom I worked from 2017 - 2019).

I'm fascinated in equal parts by Neuroscience, especially the visual system, and Machine Learning. Seeing how AI can help with fundamental scientific discoveries is remarkable. I'm happy to be there for the ride, and to contribute where I can. Looking forward to how Neuroscience and ML might co-develop.
