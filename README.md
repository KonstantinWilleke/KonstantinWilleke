### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm in pursuit of a doctoral degree at the [Max Planck International Research School for Intelligent Systems](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/), [Univerity of TÃ¼bingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/), and [University of GÃ¶ttingen](https://uni-goettingen.de/de/644835.html). Since 2019, I'm part of the [Neuronal Intelligence Team](https://sinzlab.org/), led by Fabian Sinz. I work in collaboration with [Andreas Tolias](https://toliaslab.org/), [Alexander Ecker](https://eckerlab.org/), [Katrin Franke](https://www.eye-tuebingen.de/franke/), and [Ziad Hafed](http://hafedlab.org/).

I'm fascinated in equal parts by Neuroscience, especially the visual system, and Machine Learning. Seeing how AI can help with fundamental scientific discoveries is remarkable. I'm happy to be there for the ride, and to [contribute](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05270-3) where I can. Looking forward to how Neuroscience and ML might co-develop.

In current projects, I'm building neural predictive models on the basis of CNNs to predict neuronal activity in [mouse](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05270-3) [and](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Tp7kI90Htd) [monkey](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.18.492503v1).  I'm also interested how neural data can be used to make CNNs [more](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14344) [robust](https://sinzlab.org/files/publications/Safarani2021CoTraining.pdf) to common image distortions.
I'm the lead organizer (jointly with Paul Fahey from [the Baylor College of Medicine](https://www.bcm.edu/)) of the [SENSORIUM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08666) [competition](https://sensorium2022.net/) - a multi lab effort to find the best neural predictive model of mouse V1, and at the same time making our neural predictive models [accessible](https://github.com/sinzlab/sensorium). I'm the happiest when I can create [visualizations](https://twitter.com/kfrankelab/status/1575138915899637760) and to tinker with the latest [tools](https://github.com/datajoint/datajoint-python) to help with data analysis.
